# The Film Link

Welcome to The Film Link!
This is a movie database application that can find any movie on your mind - and provide all details available for that movie, including:
Name, Description, User Rating, Release Date, Runtime, Genres, Cast & Crew, Certficiation, Trailers, Posters, Images, Watch Providers

## Registering

User's may register with The Film Link, but registering is not required as this application was designed to be used by anyone interested
Registered users do however have the benefit of:
Leaving reviews on movies, saving movies to a user-profile including Watchlist and Favorites lists
Watchlist and Favorite movies can be browsed and edited at anytime from the user-profile page

## Upcoming Sprints

Currently developing the logic for including TV as a searchable option, as well as 'People' and 'Companies' (production companies)
Later will develop specifc pages designed for TV Series results and Cast/Crew person results
Later will develop the ability to share movies between Film Link users
